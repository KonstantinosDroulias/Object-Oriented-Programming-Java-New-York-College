# This is my log book for weekly report and course work
To help me with the course I completed this free course in YouTube from Bro Code:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTtL8E4LzTQ&t=28378s
## Week 01
### 1. Custom Rectangle
It took me about 1 - 2 hours to complete the Rectangle class I could understand the logic and what I needed to do thanks to a good understanding of Python but had to get familiar with the new syntax of Java.
### 2. Pet Clinic App
After That I took a pause and that's when I started the YouTube course to help me along 4 hours in the course I decided to try the Pet Clinic app.
<br> I wanted to understand Java a bit better so I decided to add more functions to it. I did use Chat GPT and asked it how to create dictionaries like we did in Python to store the diffrent pet types as keys and then have the key point to an array with all the animals names.
<br>After understanding how to create the hasmap with the arrays the rest was eassy since the logic was no diffrent again than Python. 
#### ** I paused here again to complete the YouTube course so I can complete the rest of the tasks and upcoming weekly tasks using all the knowladge I got. **
