# This is my log book for weekly report and course work
To help me with the course I completed this free course in YouTube from Bro Code:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTtL8E4LzTQ&t=28378s
## Week 01
### 1. Custom Rectangle
It took me about 1 - 2 hours to complete the Rectangle class I could understand the logic and what I needed to do thanks to a good understanding of Python but had to get familiar with the new syntax of Java.
### 2. Pet Clinic App
After That I took a pause and that's when I started the YouTube course to help me along 4 hours in the course I decided to try the Pet Clinic app.
<br> I wanted to understand Java a bit better so I decided to add more functions to it. I did use Chat GPT and asked it how to create dictionaries like we did in Python to store the diffrent pet types as keys and then have the key point to an array with all the animals names.
<br>After understanding how to create the hasmap with the arrays the rest was easy since the logic was no different again than Python. 
### 3. Car Rental App
Here I am 8hours in the course and having learned a bit of oop plus the in person lessons in the university I gave this task a go.<br>
Completing this task really didn't seem that hard and it wasn't yet requiring too much expertise. I separated the car object in a diffrent class and then created the 5 objects I was asked to.
Then I created the menu and added the methods in the switch statement and starting completing each method one by one. As I was creating them I saw that I will need the to search in the array more than once so I created a new method just fore the search function and not after long it was complete.

## Week 02

Just completed week 2. The nor the process nor the skills I used for this app were diffrent than the last app the car rental one so I wouldn't say it was anything that difficult figuring out the logic.<br>
So to challenge my self I tried to run as clean code as I possibly could and wrote anything that was repeated or might be in the near future in it's own method.<br>
That was great training for me since that at the same time I am trying other coding languages and building stuff to learn to keep my code clean and easy to make changes/fixes since I know what is responsible for what.<br>
That's also something I grew to love about java the OOP side and I am excited to learn that in the other langauges to keep my code clean

## Week 03

Completed the week 03 task. I wanted to extended and understand how to connect a sql database with my projects and also build a desktop window app. So I watched a 4hours course for the swing library. After watching 2hours of that course I went on to the project. I also tried watching a course on java jdbc but didn't find any good quality videos explaining it. So I did this entire task with the help of chat gpt. I asked it how does jdbc work and how to make a connection and query data from my database (local hosted on my machine). And it helped me but still I had problems understanding so I asked it to complete the task for me so I can atleast have a code that works and can study from that. After carefully examining the complete code I think I understand how to query and also use the swing library. <br>
Planning on adding a login page and a product for admins to insert more books.

#### ** I paused here again to complete the YouTube 12hour Java course and 4hr swing course so I can complete the rest of the tasks and upcoming weekly tasks using a complete knowladge of Java . **

## Week 05

I have mixed feelings upon completing this. Since it wasn't specified I wanted to not use a db but store everything in a hasmap. So I did with one problem the easy solution I had in my mind end up making my GamePage.class extremely long and messy. At the end I managed to get it working but I would have preferred if I had taken the time to make the code cleaner

## Week 03 revision
I went back to <strong>week03</strong> to finish the book store. I liked this cause this project put my skills to the test and also showed me how much I've learned Java and SQL. I was able to write the code easily I was in a flow state and was moving quick. But I left it for a week in the easter holidays and I had a hard time remembering where I have parts of my code and adding new code made the addBooks class really long and I couldn't easily work. I will leave it hear I was able to code the add book function and now you have an awesome gui to add books the $100M Offers was added to test it's function and it displays. It took long time cause I had to learn a lot in the meantime and I am happy with the result. I've given it to much time to stay and solve the rest now. I need to move to my actuall assigments for the end of semester. I might come back to it at some point to also give the ability to see the books in a list and remove books (maybe also update not sure for now).
<br>Here you can see how it looked and images of my database to replicate if you'd like.

## Week 04
Doing this project reminded me how bad is to try to make a layout work with swing. I put left aligned with some other components and weird spaces start to appear I spend 1hr + trying to make the simplest layout only for the right column. Anyway, for this project I wanted to go deep in object oriented and what has to offer with simple code divided on it's own file doing a specific function only. Note I didn't add private nor protected that much cause I wanted to save a bit more time so public is used in it's place... Well that's what I would do but I actually used public static for a jetextfield and CHATGPT told me is bad practice and it brakes encapsulation an OOP principal I guess, so private it is :| . I am writting this as I am solving the task at hand. At this point I was able with my knowladge to have the order be added on the database. I needed help to display the orders in a list and I want to display with a custom design so I had to get help from chatgpt and it taught me about ListCellRender. This process of adding more feature that are required from the task allows me to use ai on the extra parts and use it to learn so when I go to the final assignments I use it less and less and I can write on my own and faster. I ended up making a kinda simple project to a lot of coplexion and I won't lie this project did require me to ask chatgpt quite a lot. I don't think that's necessarily bad. I am tackling something hard and new so if I can learn from they AI's output I will benefit plenty. Creating the csv file wasn't hard I know how to do it but adding the export button I needed chatgpt and I left the comments to not fool you of what is actual my code and what generated.
<br>Finally Completed week04. I really loved this task and I challenged my self a tone. I did use ai to help me solve part of this but I also learn from it and now believe I can replicate this project on my own, well some of it.

# FINAL ASSIGMENTS

## 1. Storage Tracking App
Unfortunately I didn't know about mvc at the time and now I am too deep to try and rearrange it. Completing this assigment took a lot of time (4 - 5 days across 3hours + sessions).
I know it's not perfect it could have better error handling and also protecting more of the empty inputs, but I think I already gave a lot to this project.

*NOTE: At the same time as I was taking that course I also complete a Javascript YouTube Course and built 2 apps on my own. A Todo List this is the link <a>https://github.com/KonstantinosDroulias/JavaScript-Todo-App</a> to the github repository(it just needs for me to add a caching functionality so users info doesn't get lost) and a calculator app with only "+" function and I did that in the codepen here is the link <a>https://codepen.io/Konstantinos-Droulias/pen/ZYEBrbw</a> (for some reason when you do plus anything with 0 it doesn't work it's like it doesn't exist example 10 + 7 = 8 haven't yet go around it). 
Also created my first google chrome extension a pomodoro timer. I am not yet as expirienced with Javascript to create extensions that can manipulate something in others websites but soon. This was a fun project helping me learn how to at least build a chrome extension here is the github link <a>https://github.com/KonstantinosDroulias/chrome-extension-pomodoro-timer</a> (in progress). 
Finally I have started a course in PHP and started developing my first plugin not ready yet and I haven't even created a repository on github for it soon I will do that and update here

!I am not natively speaking english I might have some errors I will fix them before submitting ;)
